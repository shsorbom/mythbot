Description: # sMythbot
        sMythbot is a python script for use with the Mythtv project that allows for out-of-home control of a [Mythtv DVR](https://www.mythtv.org/) via the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/). Please see the project [wiki](https://github.com/shsorbom/sMythbot/wiki) for setup information. 
        
        ## Installation Prerequisites
        This prerequisite guide assumes a modern version of Ubuntu (>= 18.04). You also neet to be running  version 0.28 or higher of Myth Tv.
        If you are running Ubuntu 18.04, you will need to install Python version 3.8 or newer. 
        I may add backwards compatability later, but for now, I reccomend installing [Pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).   
        Once you have Python set up, run the following commands in a BASH terminal:   
        `sudo apt install libmariadbclient-dev`  
        `pip3 install future`  
        `pip3 install mysqlclient`  
        `pip3 install matrix-nio`  
        `pip3 install lxml`  
        `pip3 install requests`  
        
        Now we need to get the Mythtv source code:  
        `git clone https://github.com/MythTV/mythtv`  
        ...Go to the directory where the API's we need are located:  
        `cd ./mythtv/bindings/python/`  
        ...And install the python API  
        `python3 setup.py install`  
        
        ## Known Bugs
        * Currently sMythbot hangs if you are using a self-signed SSL Certificate. I recommend using LetsEncrypt, or disabling SSL checking in the `~/.smythbot/config.ini` file.
        
        ## Miscellaneous Warts
        * E2E Encryption is not implemented yet
        * sMythbot currently has the potential to output a lot of data to a room and not many ways to limit it. Please be courteous and keep this in mind when using sMythbot on a public homeserver. 
        * All recording times are currently displayed in UTC. This will be fixed soon.
        * Matrix room permissions are not implemented yet. Only allow room access to people you trust not to damage your DVR.
