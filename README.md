# sMythbot
sMythbot is a python script for use with the Mythtv project that allows for out-of-home control of a [Mythtv DVR](https://www.mythtv.org/) via the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/). Please see the project [wiki](https://github.com/shsorbom/sMythbot/wiki) for setup information. 
## Installation: The easy way
If you have Ubuntu `snapd` installed (which is available by default on most Linux distributions), all you need to do is open a terminal and type the following:  
`sudo snap install --edge smythbot`  
And you're done with the install! 
**Note:** On some older systems (mostly 16.04 era), it may be nessescary to run `snap install core` prior to running the install comand.

## Installation: The hard way 
This prerequisite guide assumes a modern version of Ubuntu (>= 18.04). You also neet to be running  version 0.28 or higher of Myth Tv.
If you are running Ubuntu 18.04, you will need to install Python version 3.8 or newer. 
I may add backwards compatability later, but for now, I reccomend installing [Pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).   

Now we need to get the Mythtv source code:  
`git clone https://github.com/MythTV/mythtv`  
...Go to the directory where the API's we need are located:  
`cd ./mythtv/bindings/python/`  
...And install the python API  
`python3 setup.py install`   
Exit the mythtv Repo.
Next, get the sMythbot repo:  
`https://github.com/shsorbom/sMythbot.git`  
cd into the sMythbot repo and type:  
`python3 setup.py install`  
And you're (finally) done with the install.

## Known Bugs
* Currently sMythbot hangs if you are using a self-signed SSL Certificate. I recommend using LetsEncrypt, or disabling SSL checking in the `~/.smythbot/config.ini` file.

## Miscellaneous Warts
* E2E Encryption is not implemented yet
* sMythbot currently has the potential to output a lot of data to a room and not many ways to limit it. Please be courteous and keep this in mind when using sMythbot on a public homeserver. 
* All recording times are currently displayed in UTC. This will be fixed soon.
* Matrix room permissions are not implemented yet. Only allow room access to people you trust not to damage your DVR.
